Google Search API for plagiarism detection

take small chunks of text (like sentences or 50-word blocks)
query Google for exact phrases <-- this  is the slow part! --> check how many hits match the text

Pros: No hosting required, uses real web data.
Cons: APIs may be paid; search engines can block frequent automated requests.
