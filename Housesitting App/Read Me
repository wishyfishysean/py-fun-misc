## House Sitting App - fully self-contained version

I wanted to build a fully self-contained scheduling app for my housesitting side-job. 
The app was written using Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and runs as a single executablewith a GUI interface:
  - no external dependencies required beyond whatâ€™s included in the app.

# Requirements:

Calendar & Booking System:

 - A calendar view to see all booked days.
 - Ability to add, edit, or remove bookings.
 - Each booking should include a notes section for details like petcare, keys, alarms, cameras, etc.

Data Storage:

 - Store bookings locally (e.g., in a JSON, SQLite, or similar embedded database) so the app can run offline.

User Interface:

 - Clean and intuitive GUI built with HTML/CSS/JS inside a Python wrapper (like PyWebView, Tkinter + webview, or Electron-like setup using Python).
 - Calendar view should show booked days in a visually distinct way.
 - Clicking a day should open a modal or panel showing booking details and notes.

Additional Features:

 - Export bookings to CSV or PDF for offline reference.
 - Search or filter bookings by date or client.
 - Should be lightweight and simple to use.

Deliverables:

  - A Python packaged executable that can be run on Linux - used PyInstaller for this
  - Fully working GUI with all features above.
  - Well-documented code so future edits or feature additions are easy.
