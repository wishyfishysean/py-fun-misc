Warning: Some content has been AI generated or debugged.

Idea: build a simple Image Classification & Organizer System in Python that:

 - Detects images added to a folder (or manually uploaded).
 - Classifies them by type/content (e.g., cats, dogs, cars, etc.) using a pre-trained model.
 - Automatically renames and moves them into matching folders.

**Use lightweight and easy-to-install libraries, not heavy frameworks.
